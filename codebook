Notes:
=================================================
please make sure you download the raw dataset and changed the directory in the code before you start running the code.

file you should have in the process of the code:
=================================================
x - the merging data set of x train and x test with the dim of 10299 * 561
y - the merge data set of y train and y test with the dim of 10299 * 1
subject - the merge data set of subtrain and subtest with the dim of 10299 * 1
q - the list table contain all the list in x that have mean() and std()
xnew - subset table of x that only has mean and std measurement
xnew2 - pre-final table have subject, activity label with dim of 10299 * 81
summary - final table with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

different of xnew2 and summary:
=================================================
although the column name of xnew2 and summary are same, the summary table calculate the average of each variable by activity name and subject name.
you could understand in this way, if the name of one specific column in xnew2 is 'A' with its subject=1 and activity name =standing(you can find more than one of this value), the value with the same column name in 'summary' should be the mean of those value.
